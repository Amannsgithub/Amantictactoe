# Amantictactoe
Creating a project named tic-tac-toe.
tic-tac-toe is basically a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column,or a diagonal with either three o's or three x's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares, noughts and crosses.
tic-tac-toe can be used to promote a number of cognitive skills including counting and spatial skills, and color and shape identification and many more.
